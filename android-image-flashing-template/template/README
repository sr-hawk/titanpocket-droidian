Droidian
========

This archive contains fastboot-flashable images for Droidian.

To flash a device on Linux and macOS, just run the `./flash_all.sh`
script. The `fastboot` tool must be installed.
You might need to run the script as root, depending on your distro and/or
settings.

Please note that flashing Droidian will erase the existing userdata partition.
